<p> <strong>Cuban flan</strong>is a rich, creamy <em>custard dessert</em> that melts in your mouth,
     topped with a luscious layer of golden caramel. This traditional 
     treat is a staple in <em>Cuban households</em>, often enjoyed after a hearty
     meal or during special celebrations. Made with <em>sweetened condensed milk, 
     evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla</em>, <strong>Cuban flan</strong> has a smooth, velvety texture 
     and a deep caramel flavor that balances sweetness with a slight 
     bitterness from the caramelized sugar.</p>
<p>What sets it apart is its dense yet creamy consistency, achieved by 
    using a mix of <em>condensed and evaporated milk</em>, making it richer than other flan variations.
    The magic happens when the custard is baked in a caramel-lined mold, then flipped upside down 
    before serving, allowing the golden syrup to coat each silky bite. Whether served
    alone or with a dollop of whipped cream, this dessert is a timeless favorite that 
    brings a taste of <em>Cuba</em> to any table.</p>
