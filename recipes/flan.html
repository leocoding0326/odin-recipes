<p> <strong>Cuban flan</strong>is a rich, creamy <em>custard dessert</em> that melts in your mouth,
     topped with a luscious layer of golden caramel. This traditional 
     treat is a staple in <em>Cuban households</em>, often enjoyed after a hearty
     meal or during special celebrations. Made with <em>sweetened condensed milk, 
     evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla</em>, <strong>Cuban flan</strong> has a smooth, velvety texture 
     and a deep caramel flavor that balances sweetness with a slight 
     bitterness from the caramelized sugar.</p>
<p>What sets it apart is its dense yet creamy consistency, achieved by 
    using a mix of <em>condensed and evaporated milk</em>, making it richer than other flan variations.
    The magic happens when the custard is baked in a caramel-lined mold, then flipped upside down 
    before serving, allowing the golden syrup to coat each silky bite. Whether served
    alone or with a dollop of whipped cream, this dessert is a timeless favorite that 
    brings a taste of <em>Cuba</em> to any table.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h4>For the Caramel</h4>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the Custard</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h4>1.Make Caramel</h4>

<ol>
    <li>In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add 1 cup of sugar and ¼ cup of water (if using).</li>
    <li>Heat over medium-low heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the sugar melts and turns a deep amber color (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
    <li>Quickly pour the caramel into a round flan mold (or a cake pan), tilting to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
    <li>Set aside and let it harden while you prepare the custard.</li>
</ol>

<h4>2. Prepare the Custard</h4>

<ol start="5">
    <li>In a blender or mixing bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt.</li>
    <li>Blend or whisk until smooth and fully incorporated (avoid overmixing to prevent bubbles).</li>
</ol>

<h4>3. Assemble and Bake</h4>

<ol start="7">
    <li>Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the mold.</li>  
    <li>Cover the mold with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Place the mold in a larger baking dish and fill the larger dish with hot water (creating a water bath or<em> baño maría</em>).</li>
    <li>Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 50-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean but slightly moist.</li>
</ol>

<h4>4. Cool and Unmold</h4>

<ol start="11">
    <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight) for the best texture.</li>
    <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the flan, place a plate over the mold, and flip it upside down to release the flan with the caramel cascading over it.</li>
</ol>
