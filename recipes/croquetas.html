    <p><strong>Croquetas</strong> are a beloved <em>Cuban dish</em>, known for their crispy golden-brown exterior and irresistibly 
         creamy filling. These bite-sized delights are typically made with a rich <em>béchamel</em> base, combined with finely minced ham, chicken,
         or fish, then coated in breadcrumbs and fried to perfection. The result is a crunchy shell that gives way to a velvety, 
         savory center bursting with flavor. Popular as both a snack and a breakfast staple, croquetas are often enjoyed with 
         <em>Cuban coffee</em> or paired with a squeeze of lime for an extra zesty kick. Their versatility and comforting taste make them a 
         cherished part of <em>Cuban</em> cuisine, found in bakeries, cafeterías, and family gatherings alike.</p>

    <p>What makes <em>Cuban <strong>croquetas</strong></em> stand out is their smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture, achieved by carefully blending the filling 
        and allowing it to chill before shaping. Unlike other variations, they rely on a thick, flavorful roux rather 
        than mashed potatoes, giving them a uniquely creamy consistency. The breadcrumb coating provides a satisfying 
        crunch that contrasts beautifully with the soft interior, making each bite an explosion of texture and taste. 
        Whether served as an appetizer, side dish, or even tucked into a sandwich, croquetas are a timeless favorite that brings a taste
         of <em>Cuba</em> to any table
