    <p><strong>Croquetas</strong> are a beloved <em>Cuban dish</em>, known for their crispy golden-brown exterior and irresistibly 
         creamy filling. These bite-sized delights are typically made with a rich <em>béchamel</em> base, combined with finely minced ham, chicken,
         or fish, then coated in breadcrumbs and fried to perfection. The result is a crunchy shell that gives way to a velvety, 
         savory center bursting with flavor. Popular as both a snack and a breakfast staple, croquetas are often enjoyed with 
         <em>Cuban coffee</em> or paired with a squeeze of lime for an extra zesty kick. Their versatility and comforting taste make them a 
         cherished part of <em>Cuban</em> cuisine, found in bakeries, cafeterías, and family gatherings alike.</p>

    <p>What makes <em>Cuban <strong>croquetas</strong></em> stand out is their smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture, achieved by carefully blending the filling 
        and allowing it to chill before shaping. Unlike other variations, they rely on a thick, flavorful roux rather 
        than mashed potatoes, giving them a uniquely creamy consistency. The breadcrumb coating provides a satisfying 
        crunch that contrasts beautifully with the soft interior, making each bite an explosion of texture and taste. 
        Whether served as an appetizer, side dish, or even tucked into a sandwich, croquetas are a timeless favorite that brings a taste
         of <em>Cuba</em> to any table

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups finely minced cooked ham (or chicken, fish, or beef)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced onion (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 ½ cups whole milk (warm)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg (optional, for depth of flavor)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Coating</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs (beaten)</li>
      <li>1 cup fine breadcrumbs (plus more if needed)</li> 
    </ul>

    <h4>For Frying</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable or canola oil (for deep frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h4>1. Make the Filling (Bechamel)</h4>
    
    <ol>
       <li>In a large skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>(Optional) If using onions, sauté ½ cup of finely diced onions in the butter until soft and translucent (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
        <li>Gradually add ½ cup of flour, stirring continuously to form a roux. Cook for about 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in 1 ½ cups of warm milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>Add nutmeg, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder, then mix well. The mixture should thicken into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Stir in 2 cups of finely minced ham until well incorporated. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2. Chill the Mixture</h4>

    <ol start="7">
        <li>Transfer the filling to a bowl or baking dish and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours (or overnight) until firm enough to shape.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3. Shape the Croquetas</h4>
    
    <ol start="10">
        <li>Once chilled, take small portions of the mixture and roll into oval or cylindrical shapes (about 2 inches long).</li>
        <li>Place the shaped croquetas on a tray and return them to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to firm up again.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>4. Coat the Croquetas</h4>

    <ol start="12">
        <li>In one bowl, beat 2 eggs.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, place 1 cup of fine breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dip each croqueta into the egg mixture, then roll it in the breadcrumbs until fully coated. For extra crispiness, repeat this step for a double coating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>5. Fry to Perfection</h4>
    
    <ol start="15">
        <li>In a deep frying pan, heat vegetable or canola oil to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the croquetas in small batches for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Avoid overcrowding the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>6. Serve and Enjoy!</h4>

    <ol start="18">
        <li>Serve warm, optionally with a squeeze of lime, mustard, or a side of <a href="./cuban-bread.html">Cuban bread.</a></li>
    </ol>
