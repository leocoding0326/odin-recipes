    <p> <strong>Cuban bread</strong>, or <em>Pan Cubano</em>, is a staple of <em>Cuban cuisine</em>, known for its light, airy interior and crispy, golden crust.
         Unlike traditional baguettes, <strong>Cuban bread</strong> has a slightly softer texture with a delicate chew, making it perfect for sandwiches
         like the famous <em>Cubano</em>. One of its defining characteristics is the use of lard, which gives it a subtle richness and a signature 
         tenderness that sets it apart from other white breads. Traditionally, a palm frond is placed on top of the dough before baking, 
         creating the classic split down the center—though a simple score with a knife works just as well.</p>

    <p>This bread is more than just a sandwich base; its a cherished part of Cuban breakfasts, often enjoyed toasted with butter
         and paired with <em>café con leche</em>. Its crusty exterior and pillowy inside make it the perfect complement to both sweet and savory
         dishes. Whether you are using it for sandwiches, dipping it into soups, or enjoying it fresh from the oven, <strong>Cuban</strong> bread is a simple
         yet essential part of <em>Cuban culinary tradition</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 

    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups bread flour (or all-purpose flour)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (about 110°F / 43°C)</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lard (or vegetable shortening)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Baking</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1-2 pieces of palm fronds (or parchment paper, optional)</li>
        <li>A small oven-safe pan with water (for steam)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h4>1. Activate the Yeast</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast.</li>
        <li>Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. This means the yeast is active.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2. Make the Dough</h4>

    <ol start="3">
        <li>In a large mixing bowl (or stand mixer), combine flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Add lard (or shortening) and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If using a stand mixer, use the dough hook on medium speed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3.  First Rise (Proofing)</h4>

    <ol start="6">
      <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover with a clean towel.</li>
      <li>Let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>  
    </ol>

    <h4>4. Shape the Loaves</h4>

    <ol start="8">
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a long log shape (about 12 inches long).</li>
        <li>Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving space between them.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>5. Second Rise</h4>

    <ol start="11">
        <li>Cover the loaves with a clean towel and let them rise for another 45-60 minutes until slightly puffed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>6. Prepare for Baking</h4>
    
    <ol start="12">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Place a small oven-safe pan with water on the bottom rack (this creates steam for a crispy crust).</li>
        <li>If using palm fronds, lay one down the center of each loaf (or make a light score with a knife).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>7. Bake the Bread</h4>
    
    <ol start="15">
       <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</li> 
    </ol>

    <h4>8. Cool and Enjoy!</h4>
