    <p> <strong>Cuban bread</strong>, or <em>Pan Cubano</em>, is a staple of <em>Cuban cuisine</em>, known for its light, airy interior and crispy, golden crust.
         Unlike traditional baguettes, <strong>Cuban bread</strong> has a slightly softer texture with a delicate chew, making it perfect for sandwiches
         like the famous <em>Cubano</em>. One of its defining characteristics is the use of lard, which gives it a subtle richness and a signature 
         tenderness that sets it apart from other white breads. Traditionally, a palm frond is placed on top of the dough before baking, 
         creating the classic split down the center—though a simple score with a knife works just as well.</p>

    <p>This bread is more than just a sandwich base; its a cherished part of Cuban breakfasts, often enjoyed toasted with butter
         and paired with <em>café con leche</em>. Its crusty exterior and pillowy inside make it the perfect complement to both sweet and savory
         dishes. Whether you are using it for sandwiches, dipping it into soups, or enjoying it fresh from the oven, <strong>Cuban</strong> bread is a simple
         yet essential part of <em>Cuban culinary tradition</em>.</p>
